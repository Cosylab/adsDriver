# EPICS ADS Device Support

* Code repository: https://github.com/cosylab/adsDriver
* Online documentation: https://epics.cosylab.com/documentation/adsDriver

This device support library is used for communication with Beckhoff ADS devices.
It implements the layer between Beckhoff ADS client library and EPICS database
records. The library handles read/write requests initiated by database records
and converts them to ADS client library calls.

More information can be found in the EPICS ADS Reference Manual which is located
in `documentation` folder. Compiling documentation to html requires python-sphinx.

# Dependencies
